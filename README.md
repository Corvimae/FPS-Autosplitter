# Fashion Police Squad Autosplitter

Requires Just-Ero's UnityASL component: https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/blob/main/Components/UnityASL.bin

Removes loads and splits on every Parole Ball scene.

Timing starts when the intro cutscene begins playing, and will automatically reset when exiting to the main menu.
